Friends of the Library of Rio Rancho development website

Friends of the Library of Rio Ranch, Inc. is an all-volunteer, membership organization. We were incorporated in 1982 as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit corporation.

We fund all programs and activities for children, teens and adults at the Loma Colorado Library and Esther Bone Memorial Library in Rio Rancho, New Mexico. The biggest program we support each year is the summer-reading program. We also fund the Books For Babies early literacy program.

This is the development (pre-deployment) website for the Friends.
